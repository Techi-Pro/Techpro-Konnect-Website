# Admin Dashboard Setup Guide

## Quick Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Admin User
First, you need to create an admin user in your database. You can do this by:

1. **Using your existing user registration endpoint** (`POST /api/v1/users`)
2. **Manually updating the user role** in your database to 'ADMIN'

Example user creation:
```json
POST https://techiproconnect.onrender.com/api/v1/users
{
  "username": "admin@techpro.com",
  "email": "admin@techpro.com", 
  "password": "your_secure_password"
}
```

Then update the user record in your database:
```sql
UPDATE users SET role = 'ADMIN' WHERE email = 'admin@techpro.com';
```

### 2. Access the Dashboard

1. **Direct URL**: Navigate to `yourdomain.com/admin-login.html`
2. **From main site**: Click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the navigation
3. **Login** with your admin credentials

### 3. API Compatibility Notes

The dashboard has been updated to work with your existing API structure:

#### Authentication
- Uses your standard `/login` endpoint
- Passes email as `username` field (as your API expects)
- Stores JWT token for authenticated requests

#### Available Endpoints Used
- `GET /admin/kyc-statistics` - Dashboard statistics
- `GET /admin/technicians/pending-review` - Technicians for review
- `POST /admin/technicians/{id}/final-verification` - Approve/reject decisions

#### Missing Endpoints (Optional)
These endpoints would enhance the dashboard but aren't required:
- `GET /admin/verify-token` - Token validation
- `GET /admin/recent-kyc-submissions` - Recent activity
- `GET /admin/technicians/{id}/details` - Detailed technician info

### 4. Dashboard Features

#### ‚úÖ Working Features
- **Statistics Dashboard** - Shows KYC counts and status
- **Pending Reviews** - List of technicians awaiting approval
- **Document Preview** - View uploaded documents
- **Approve/Reject** - Make verification decisions with notes
- **Responsive Design** - Works on mobile and desktop

#### üîß Status Mapping
The dashboard handles these Firebase KYC statuses:
- `PENDING` - Initial state
- `PROCESSING` - Firebase processing
- `FIREBASE_VERIFIED` - Passed Firebase checks
- `FIREBASE_REJECTED` - Failed Firebase checks  
- `FIREBASE_ERROR` - Firebase processing error
- `ADMIN_REVIEW_REQUIRED` - Needs manual review
- `AWAITING_ADMIN_REVIEW` - Same as above

### 5. Security Considerations

#### Current Implementation
- Token-based authentication using your existing JWT system
- Admin role verification happens at API level
- Secure token storage in localStorage

#### Recommendations for Production
1. **HTTPS Only** - Ensure all API calls use HTTPS
2. **Token Expiry** - Implement token refresh or reasonable expiry
3. **Role Verification** - Add middleware to verify admin role on API endpoints
4. **Audit Logging** - Log all admin actions for compliance

### 6. Customization

#### Adding New Features
1. **New Sidebar Items** - Add to navigation in `admin-dashboard.html`
2. **New Content Sections** - Create corresponding content divs
3. **JavaScript Functions** - Add handlers in `admin-dashboard.js`
4. **API Integration** - Connect to your backend endpoints

#### Styling
- Uses same Bootstrap 5 framework as main site
- Consistent color scheme (#4f83d1, #7cb8eb)
- Easy to modify CSS in the `<style>` section

### 7. Testing Checklist

Before going live, test these scenarios:

#### ‚úÖ Authentication Flow
- [ ] Admin can login with correct credentials
- [ ] Invalid credentials show error message
- [ ] Token is stored and persists across page refreshes
- [ ] Logout clears token and redirects

#### ‚úÖ Dashboard Functions
- [ ] Statistics load correctly
- [ ] Pending reviews display with data
- [ ] Document images load and can be viewed
- [ ] Approve/reject actions work
- [ ] Success/error messages appear

#### ‚úÖ Responsive Design
- [ ] Works on mobile phones
- [ ] Works on tablets
- [ ] Works on desktop computers
- [ ] Navigation is accessible on all screen sizes

### 8. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**"Unable to load dashboard data"**
- Check API server is running
- Verify admin endpoints are accessible
- Check browser console for errors

**"Login failed"** 
- Verify admin user exists in database
- Check user has 'ADMIN' role
- Verify password is correct

**"Documents not loading"**
- Check Firebase Storage URLs are publicly accessible
- Verify CORS settings allow image loading
- Check network connectivity

**"Actions not working"**
- Verify final-verification endpoint is implemented
- Check request/response format matches API
- Look for JavaScript errors in console

### 9. Production Deployment

#### Environment Variables
Update the API URL in production:
```javascript
// In admin-dashboard.js
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://yourdomain.com/api/v1';
```

#### File Structure
Upload these files to your web server:
```
admin-dashboard.html
admin-login.html
js/admin-dashboard.js
```

#### Web Server Configuration
Ensure your web server serves these files and handles routing properly.

### 10. Future Enhancements

#### Suggested Improvements
1. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket integration for live updates
2. **Advanced Filtering** - Filter by date, category, status
3. **Bulk Actions** - Approve/reject multiple technicians
4. **Export Functions** - Download reports as CSV/PDF
5. **Analytics Charts** - Visual statistics with Chart.js
6. **Notification System** - Email alerts for pending reviews

The admin dashboard is now fully compatible with your API and ready for use! üöÄ
